# Overwatch
Pick a random hero, gamemode, role, show info about a hero or play a quiz (singleplayer and multiplayer) among other things.

The script only runs in the terminal.

In the terminal, run:
1.     git clone https://github.com/Crinibus/overwatch.git
2.     pip install -r requirements.txt
3.     python random_overwatch.py

If you try my script, please give feedback. This is my first "big" project.
